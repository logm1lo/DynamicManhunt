This plugin provides unique abilities, environmental challenges, and random supply drops, enhancing the thrill of the chase and strategic gameplay.

## Project Description

### Challenges Faced:
During development, challenges included balancing the gameplay mechanics to ensure fairness and excitement for both hunters and runners. Future features may include more environmental hazards and additional gameplay mechanics to enhance player engagement.
