# Dynamic Manhunt

**Dynamic Manhunt** is an action-packed Minecraft plugin that brings a new layer of excitement to the game with a custom manhunt mode. Players take on roles as **hunters** and **runners**, each with distinct abilities and objectives. The game is further enriched with random supply drops, overpowered weapon deliveries, and environmental events that intensify the thrill of the chase.

## 🚀 Project Description

Dynamic Manhunt transforms the classic Minecraft manhunt into a high-intensity, unpredictable experience. The plugin introduces several gameplay-enhancing features, including:

### 🔥 Key Features
- **Randomized player roles**: Hunters and runners are chosen at random.
- **Unique abilities for hunters**: Providing tactical advantages during the chase.
- **Environmental events**: Including floods and earthquakes that keep players on edge.
- **Random supply drops**: Featuring **overpowered weapons** and items that shift the game's balance.
- **Simple command system**: For easy game control and management.

### 🛠 Technologies
- **Java**: The primary programming language.
- **Bukkit API**: Allows the plugin to interact with Minecraft’s server features.

### 🚧 Development Challenges
During development, one of the core challenges was ensuring balanced gameplay. The introduction of overpowered weapons required careful attention to timing and power scaling to keep the game fair yet exhilarating for both hunters and runners. Future updates may introduce additional environmental hazards and mechanics to further enhance player immersion.
